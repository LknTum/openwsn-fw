A bootloader is the piece of course which allow you to upload a new binary onto a board, usually over the serial port. Some boards, such as some M\+S\+P430-\/based boards, have a bootloader built-\/in. For others, you need to load some little program over J\+T\+AG. This directory contains such bootloaders for a couple of boards.

The code in this directory is N\+OT directly used in the Open\+W\+SN stack.
