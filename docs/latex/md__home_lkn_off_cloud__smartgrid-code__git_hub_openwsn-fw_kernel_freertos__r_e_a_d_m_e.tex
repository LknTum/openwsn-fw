Free\+R\+T\+OS is a full-\/featured preemtive task scheduler developed by Real Time Engineers Ltd (N\+OT the Open\+W\+SN team) and available at \href{http://www.freertos.org/}{\tt http\+://www.\+freertos.\+org/}.

In accordance with the Free\+R\+T\+OS licensing model, we are including it in unmodified source code.

This directory can contain several directories, one for each version of Free\+R\+T\+OS used. Because the downloaded version of Free\+R\+T\+OS contains many files, we have removed all the unused files and folders, while keeping the directory structure, so we can easily upgrade to future revisions of Free\+R\+T\+OS.
