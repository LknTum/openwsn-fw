Documentation Instruction
--------------------------

This file contains the instruction on how to BUILD and MODIFY the Doxygen documentation.


BUILD
------

In order to build the documentation just follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and move in the folder containing the file "Doxyfile"
2. From the terminal run one of the two commands
   
   - $ doxygen Doxyfile -> generates the folders containing the documentation
   OR
   - $ doxywizard Doxyfile -> opens the wizard, useful if the previus command has errors

3. The default documentation is generated into different folders:
   - html/index.html
   - latex/refman.tex


MODIFY
-------
The LKN documentation was build using the following guidelines.

The Doxygen documentation is divided in different HTML pages:

- 'Main Page': contains the high level description of the project, and contains link to pages (also available in the section 'Related Pages').
 - 'LKN contribution': Provides a full description of the project's modifications, it is divided into topic related sections
 - 'LKN code edits': provides a list view of the LKN code modifications.

The pages 'Main Page' and 'LKN contribution' are defined in the "README.dox" file. From there, it is possible to structure the pages and the sections in a Latex-like way. The main commands used in this files are:

- @ref <name>: reference to the code's member <name> (function, variable, enum,...), it provides a link to the element
- @snippet PATH_FROM_HOME_FOLDER <CODE_SNIPPET_TAG>: Includes the code of the file at location PATH_FROM_HOME_FOLDER that is contained between TWO tags in the following way:
  ///@internal [CODE_SNIPPET_TAG]
  My code
  ///@internal [CODE_SNIPPET_TAG]

The page 'LKN code edits' is built automatically by using the ad-hoc command:
  /// @lkn{EDITOR_NAME} Description of the edit

The command refers and links to any definition that FOLLOWS the tag.

The command is enabled defining the following ALIAS:

- From the doxywizard, in the section 'Expert->Topic->Project->ALIASES', add the line
  lkn{1}= \xrefitem LKN_code_edits "LKN-\1"  "LKN code edits" 

The setup of this command is already contained in the Doxyfile, it should work automatically using this Doxygen setup.

More information about these and new commands can be found at the Doxygen manual page, following this link:
