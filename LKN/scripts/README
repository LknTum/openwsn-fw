QUICK INSTALLATION
---------------------
0. Move to the scripts folder.
1. Install the sources and libraries using './0-InstallPackages'
2. Program the motes with './1b-BuildUploadHW.sh /dev/ttyUSBX' , where X is the number of the USB serial peripheral in your system.
3. Finally, run the GUI with ./StartGui


OPENWSN INSTALLATION
---------------------

In order to install the proper Linux packages and clone the OpenWSN
repositories, it is sufficient to run the script '0-InstallPackages.sh'.


BUILD OPENWSN 
--------------

Once everything is set up, it is possible to build specific OpenWSN fw. In
particular, by means of these scripts, it is possible to:

  * Build OpenWSN and run simulated motes: 
	To do so, it is sufficient to run the script '1a-BuildandRun_Simulator.sh'. This
	script builds the simulated motes and starts the GUI using the web
	interface.

  * To build and upload the firmware run '1b-BuildUploadHW.sh'. It is
	possible to modify the the serial port where to upload the fw
	modifying the 'bootload=' option. Additionally, it is possible to
	modify the name of the project ('oos_openwsn' by default) by choosing
	a different project name as last parameter of the 'scons' command.

	Finally, it is sufficient to run the script '2-StartGUI.sh' to start the
	GUI. It is possible to switch between the python GUI ('rungui') and
	web GUI ('runweb') by inserting/removing comments in the script.
