{\ttfamily openos} is a simple run-\/to-\/completion non-\/preemtive task scheduler developed by the Open\+W\+SN team.

While it does not offer all the features of an R\+T\+OS such as Free\+R\+T\+OS (\href{http://www.freertos.org/}{\tt http\+://www.\+freertos.\+org/}), in particular preemtion, it is also less memory-\/hungry since it is single-\/threaded.

Because of its simplicity and applicability to very R\+A\+M-\/constrained devices, the openos kernel is maintained alongside more full-\/featured R\+T\+OS kernels.
